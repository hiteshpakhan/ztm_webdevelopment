inside src folder the file App.js 
you can actually change the javascript inside app function
inside the function you can create the component of the page 
there are two types to build the components in javascript 
1> by function     (most use is the by function component)
2> and by class 

* we have the command inside the index.js (import ReactDOM from "react-dom") that will link the react to the DOM

* the function App() inside the App.js is the best example of the component by function

* inside the function we can write the html like code

* that not javascript or nor the html it is called JSX

* generally we cannot use the html like format inside the javascript but with react it is possible

* react provide you the facility to import the files like css or the images into the other files that cannot possible with the only javascript

* if you want to write the javascript inside the component function you can write it inside the qurly brackets {} 

# sigma rule of react :
     1> whatever you add to the index.js file it direct combines with 
     the root element of the index.html and directly access by the browser

     2> whenever you want to pass more than one component through the JSX 
     you have to wrap both component into single component 
     for example :
     <div>
          <h1>first component</h1>
          <p>second component</p>
     </div>
